## User Experience Design

### Voice Interaction Flow
1. **Wake Word Detection**: User says "Hey Teamloop"
2. **Visual Feedback**: Dashboard shows listening indicator
3. **Command Processing**: Whisper converts speech to text
4. **Intent Recognition**: System understands user intent
5. **Action Execution**: Perform requested action or query
6. **Voice Response**: ElevenLabs provides natural voice feedback
7. **Visual Update**: Dashboard updates to reflect changes

### Accessibility Features
