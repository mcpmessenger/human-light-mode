# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Research

Based on the initial search results, MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that allows AI models to interact with various tools and data sources. It acts as a bridge between AI assistants and external applications, enabling them to perform actions in the real world.

Key takeaways:

*   **Purpose:** MCP connects AI to various applications and services, allowing AI to do more than just chat.
*   **How it works:** It defines a standard for communication between an AI client and a server, specifying message formats and actions.
*   **Zapier's Role:** Zapier provides an MCP server that connects to its vast library of integrations (over 30,000 actions), allowing developers to easily add capabilities to their AI applications without building individual integrations.
*   **Use Cases:** Automating tasks, interacting with work tools and data, and creating more powerful AI assistants.
*   **Target Audience:** Primarily developers who are building AI applications.

This information provides a good foundation for understanding the purpose of the "human-light-mode" project. It seems to be a client or application that leverages the MCP protocol.
