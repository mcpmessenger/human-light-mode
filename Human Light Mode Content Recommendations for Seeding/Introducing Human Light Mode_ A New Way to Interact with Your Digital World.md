# Introducing Human Light Mode: A New Way to Interact with Your Digital World

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, we're constantly juggling a multitude of applications and services. From managing our calendars and to-do lists to communicating with colleagues and friends, our digital lives are spread across a growing number of platforms. This can lead to a fragmented and inefficient experience, where we spend more time switching between apps than actually getting things done.

What if there was a better way? What if you could interact with all of your favorite tools and services from a single, streamlined interface? That's the vision behind Human Light Mode.

## What is Human Light Mode?

Human Light Mode is an open-source project that leverages the power of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a unified and intuitive user experience. MCP is a new standard that allows AI models to securely interact with a wide range of applications and services. With Human Light Mode, you can connect to your favorite tools and services and interact with them using natural language commands.
